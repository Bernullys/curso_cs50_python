#### Video Demo: <URL>
#### Description:

# This project is design to be use while running a bar restaurant or a similar buisness. It has several characteristics that are very usefull for a restaurant owner.
# The characteristics of this project are in a dict named "options" which every key describes a feature that can be executed typing its value. These options are shown in the Terminal when the user run the file project.py. Once the user run the program project.py, a function call presentation() will be executed inmediatly, which with a time delay  (usig time module) will ask the user to select the number of the feature which the user need or prefer.

Now these features will be explaned:




# The menu is going to be into a csv file with the description of each product, its amount and its price. This menu will be display any time with styles.
# We need a file where we got the stock of each product. We are  going to add a functionallity wich can add and take out products.
# Functionallity: we can add new products to the stock file. It should check if the product already exists.
# We can delete products of the stock file. It shoud check if the product exist, and if you really want to delete it.
# We can change the price of any product.
# Admin user ??

# The main function is to take the bill by table and then when asked print it.
# It has to add the taxes and tips.
# It has to confirm if the bill was paid, or only was to show to the costumer.
# Once the bill is paid, we shoud print a pdf with a nice format, and the company logo. Add date and time to the bill.
# Also the pdf has to be saved into a directory.

# Also has to keep adding the sells by day.
# We want to keep track of how many products has been sell by name.
# It has to be a register of the payment method: card, cash o transfer.

# How will I run this application?
    The first idea that came to me is: when run the program promp the user for the app options, which are:
        - Show the menu.
        - Initialize a bill.
        - Print the bill by table.
        - Confirm if the bill was paid or not.
        - Save the bill in PDF format.
        - Add a new product to the menu.
        - Delete a product from the menu.
        - Add more of an specific item.
        - Show the stock.
        - Change the price of a product.
        - Check today sells.
